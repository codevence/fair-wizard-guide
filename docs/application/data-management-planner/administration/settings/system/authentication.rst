Authentication Settings
***********************

The **Default Role** settings option allows us to define which role is assigned to new users (see :ref:`user roles<user-roles>` for details about permissions).


.. WARNING::
    
    It is recommended to set this to the lowest role possible, i.e. **Researchers**. Otherwise, new users will be able to change the content for all other users in the |project_name| instance.
