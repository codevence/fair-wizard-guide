Organization Settings
*********************

On this page, we can configure **Name**, **Description**, and **Organization ID** for our |project_name| instance. The organization ID can contain alphanumeric characters and dot symbol (but cannot start or end with dot).

.. NOTE::

    It is recommended to use period as for domain name or to use it for capturing organizational structure in the ID, for example, ``faculty.university`` or ``group.faculty.university``.
