Reporting
*********

Reporting is an application for management of reports. It allows scraping of data from other apps, and then creating reports based on that data.

Reporting can be currently done on top of :ref:`projects<reporting-projects>` and :ref:`users<reporting-users>`.

To get latest data, click on :guilabel:`Scrape now` button. This will scrape the data from the other apps and store it in the reporting database.
