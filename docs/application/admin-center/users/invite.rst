Invite User
***********

As administrators, we can create new users manually by clicking :guilabel:`Invite` on the :ref:`users list<user-list>` and submitting the form. Each user must have a unique email address, first name and last name and assigned :ref:`role<user-roles>`. Optionally, a user can have affiliation specified.

.. TODO::

    Add screenshot of user creation form


.. NOTE::

    If the user is created by administrator, the user is activated by default and no email is sent to the user.
