User Groups
***********

As an administrator, we can view analytics of user groups. We can create and edit views by selecting from many different fields and see how our projects are doing. The view can be modified and save to be reviewed later. The data can also be exported to a CSV file.

Various fields have filters that can be used to narrow down the data.

We can also resize all rows height by clicking on the double arrow in the top left corner. If we want to edit width or height of individual cells, we can do it using drag-and-drop on the borders. Lastly we can edit how many rows are on the page by clicking on the :guilabel:`Items per page` dropdown menu.

.. NOTE::

    Don't forget to click on :guilabel:`Save` icon after you are done with editing the view.


By clicking on the user group name, we can open the user group details. We can see user group metadata, such as the description or date created. The :guilabel:`Members` and :guilabel:`Projects` tabs show the number of respective items. In the :guilabel:`Members` tab, we can see the members of the group and their roles. In the :guilabel:`Projects` tab, we can see the projects that have the group assigned, as well as the role assigned to the user group.
