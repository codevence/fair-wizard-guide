Internal Settings
*****************

Internal Settings allow us to enable or disable registration. Once turned off, users can only register using other ways, e.g. OpenID or SAML.

We can also enable or disable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for users. If enabled, users will be required to enter a one-time code sent to their email address after entering their password.
