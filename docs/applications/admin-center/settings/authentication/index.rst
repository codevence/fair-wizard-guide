Authentication Settings
***********************

The Authentication Settings page allows you to configure the authentication settings for users. You can configure the following settings:

- **Internal**: This is the default authentication method. You can configure the settings for the internal authentication method.
- **Open ID**: You can configure specific `Open ID <https://openid.net/>`__ authentications.
- **SAML**: You can configure specific `SAML <https://wiki.oasis-open.org/security/FrontPage>`__ authentications. However SAML configuration requires certain technical knowledge and cannot be done only in the FAIR Wizard.

The FAIR Wizard also supports `Shibboleth <https://www.shibboleth.net/>`__ and `eduGAIN <https://edugain.org/>`__.

.. NOTE::

    For configuration of SAML, Shibboleth or eduGAIN please `contact the FAIR Wizard team <mailto:info@fair-wizard.com>`__.
