Data Stewardship Wizard provides a simple way to create a project using a Knowledge Model and fill the questionnaire in a smart way - only relevant questions for your case will be shown. A project in the DSW is approximately equaled to a data management plan.

These phases differ in number and completeness of the questions answered in the project's questionnaire.

Project Phases
""""

A project can have few phases - Before submitting the proposal, Before submitting the data management plan, and Before finishing the project. These phases differ in number and completeness of the questions answered in the project's questionnaire. Your Data Steward can also set up other project phases.

Questionnaire
""""

A representation of the Knowledge Model in the shape of a form for filling-in.
