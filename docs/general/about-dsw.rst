About DSW
=========

What is Data Stewardship Wizard and how it can help you and your research?

DSW
--------

Data Stewardship Wizard is a joint `ELIXIR CZ <https://www.elixir-czech.cz/>`__ and `ELIXIR NL <https://www.dtls.nl/elixir-nl/>`__ project bringing a simple but powerful solution for researchers to help them understand what is needed for a good, FAIR-oriented Data Stewardship, and to help them to build their own Data Management Plans. The Data Stewardship Wizard can also function as a checklist for data management professionals, like the checklists used by pilots before each flight.

FAIR
--------

The main driver for the DSW is now to offer a convenient helpful tool for data stewards and researchers. Given limited funding, we focus on this mission now. However, from a long-term perspective, the richness of knowledge contained in the Wizard definitively calls for being FAIR. On this page, we track the progress of compliance with the `FAIR principles <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>`__.

Machine-Actionable DMPs
--------

We are part of the initiative  `#activeDMPs <https://activedmps.org/>`__. Here, we will post updates on concrete steps, mostly with the respect to the identified use cases. The work on this front will continue according to our available capacity and funding.
