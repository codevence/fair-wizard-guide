Update Knowledge Model
=======================

.. NOTE::

    You can update a Knowledge Model to the later version only if there exists any (in that case there is an `update available` mark next to the Knowledge Model version number).

    An outdated Knowledge Model means that there were some changes done to the original Knowledge Model that your Knowledge Model is based on. If you want to reflect these changes in your Knowledge model as well, you have to update it as described below.

Click on "Knowledge Models" and then on "Editors" in Sidebar.
