Not sure how to make your DMP machine-actionable?

----

.. NOTE::

    Machine-actionability - unlike working with blocks of text that are hard to read and work with for machines, DSW uses a bare minimum of free text and uses UUID instead for each question and answer in its machine-actionable DMPs so that machines can read them easily and decide accordingly to spare your time and effort.

Machine-Actionable DMP
======================

To make sure your DMP is machine-actionable, go to the :doc:`./project-settings` and choose for your DMP a machine-actionable Default template (eg. maDMP).

.. TODO::

    Add Screenshot Select Machine-Actionable DMP

.. WARNING::

    To process the change of making your Project machine-actionable don't forget to click on the "Save" button!
