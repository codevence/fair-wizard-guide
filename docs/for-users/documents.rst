Not sure how to manage documents inside of a Project?

This section of the Project displays all documents for the project. You can download the document, delete it, or navigate to a questionnaire used for the DMP. If there is a submission service configured for the template, you may submit such documents.

.. WARNING::

    To be able to manage the documents, choose a template and a format in the :doc:`./project-settings`, and save your choice.
