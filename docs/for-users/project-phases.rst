Not sure how to change a phase of your Project?

----

A project can have phases. In the Common DSW Knowledge Model there are three:

* Before submitting the proposal
* Before submitting the data management plan
* Before finishing the project

However, your Data Steward can set other phases for your Project. These phases can also differ in number and completeness of the questions answered in the projectÂ´s questionnaire.
