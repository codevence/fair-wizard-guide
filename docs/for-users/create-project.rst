----

.. TODO::

.. TODO::

    Add screenshot Click on create button in Projects

Now you can create your new Project.

.. NOTE::

    You can create your Project either as "Custom" which means from scratch or you can use available Templates.

    Project Templates are templates pre-created by data stewards that should simplify the DMP creation process for researchers. Data steward can set default Knowledge Model, document template, and even pre-fill parts of the questionnaire and thus make the DMP creation for researchers much easier. This feature has to be allowed by an administrator of the organization first, then the specific Project can be enabled as Project Template by the data steward. Researchers then can choose if they want to create their Project from scratch (Custom) or from the Template.

.. TODO::

    Add screenshot Select Create Project From Template

.. WARNING::

    To finish creating the Project don't forget to click on the "Save" button!

.. TODO::

    Add link to Project Migration

.. NOTE::

    Note that the name of the Project can be changed later but the choice of the Knowledge Model can be changed only through a :doc:`./project-migration`.
