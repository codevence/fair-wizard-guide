Project Importers Development
*****************************

.. WARNING::

    Project importers are an experimental feature.

Project importers can be used to import the data from an external resource to |project_name| questionnaire. The importer creates the replies based on the data, therefore it needs to know the structure of the knowledge model it is compatible with.

FAIR Wizard comes with two importers already implemented. 

    - Replies Importer
    - maDMP Importer

.. NOTE::

    More importers can be added in the future. Please `contact the development team <info@codevence.com>`__ if you are interested in adding a new importer.
