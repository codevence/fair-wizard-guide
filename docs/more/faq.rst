FAQ

This section provides answers to frequently asked questions about the FAIR Wizard. The questions are divided into three categories: Researchers, Data Stewards, and Admins. If you have a question that is not answered here, please contact the `FAIR Wizard support team <mailto:support@fair-wizard.com>`_.

Researchers
===========

Error message in Integration Question Unable to get type hints
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Integration Question has not been set up properly. Ask your Data Steward to fix it. This error can also be caused by the external service not being available at the moment.

I don't see any Document Templates available in a Project
---------------------------------------------------------

Contact your Data Steward. They are responsible for management of Document Templates in your organization.

Data Stewards
==================

Document Templates show “Unsupported Metamodel"
-----------------------------------------------

FAIR Wizard managed Document Templates are updated automatically. You can always find new versions in the `FAIR Wizard Registry <https://registry.fair-wizard.com/document-templates>`_. The FAIR Wizard also has information on new version of Document Templates in the Registry and will indicate that there is a newer version by yellow button :guilabel:`Update available`.

If this button is not present, check if templates are published by FAIR Wizard. If they are published by DSW, please switch to FAIR Wizard templates you can import from the Registry as the DSW templates are no longer managed for the FAIR Wizard.

If you are using your own templates, you need to update them yourself according to :ref:`Document Template Specifications<document-template-metamodel-versions>`.

Researchers don’t see Knowledge Model/Document Template
-------------------------------------------------------

Knowledge Models and Document Templates must be published to be visible to Researchers. You can publish them in their respected editors.

Researchers don’t see Project Template
--------------------------------------

Project templates follow the same rules for sharing as regular projects. Therefore, to make it available for other users, you need to set up :ref:`sharing settings<sharing>` properly.
